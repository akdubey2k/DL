    "Often it becomes necessary to see what's going on inside your neural network. **Tensorboard** is a tool that comes with **tensorflow** and it allows you to **visualize neural network** as well as how it trains itself. This tool is very helpful in debugging issues too. We will use the notebook that we created in previous videos for **_recognizing handwritten digits and visualize accuracy, loss with every epoch using tensorboard._** We will also look at the visual graphs of neural network along with some internal computations.\n",
